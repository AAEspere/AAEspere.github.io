                    <p>Hello, my name is Aaron Espere. I'm 22 years old, and currently living in my hometown of Sterling Heights. I am a Wayne State graduate of 2020 with a Bachelor in Computer Science. Welcome 
                        to my website, which serves as a online portfolio and such. Currently, I'm looking for a position in Software Engineering.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I'm really interested in technology: hardware and software. It's fascinating how fast technology was incorporated into everyday life
                        over the span of the last few decades - and it's continually progressing. It's everywhere now, and I get excited seeing new innovations
                        (some of my favorite being VR and automatic driving). What I really want to do is create something that will be useful to people
                        and be something that I am proud of. I've been starting small with things like small games or apps, but later on I want to
                        take part in something really big. 
                        <h4>Background:</h4>
                        I originally wasn't into coding at all. I did a little bit of coding in high school and decided I 
                        couldn't see myself working as a coder. I went into university studying Pre-med with aspirations to become a pharmacist.
                        Halfway through my sophomore year, I realized that medicine wasn't really working out for me - and switched my major to 
                        Computer Science just because I like technology. I've stuck with it ever since, and I really do prefer it. 
                        I like the concepts, seeing how everything has an effect on the technology I use every day. I also like coding in general:
                        I like seeing everything in my code editor, structuring everything into different classes and functions, the challenge 
                        it gives me when trying to troubleshoot or problem solve, and I like seeing everything come together at the end when the product
                        is finished.
