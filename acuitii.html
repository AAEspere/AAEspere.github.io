                <p>For my senior Capstone project, me and three others worked with a company called Acuitii to create an admin server
                    for their mobile application. Acuitii is a medical company that aims to help medical education by creating means
                    for students to learn medical information easier. They are currently developing a mobile application that serves as 
                    a quiz game. More information about the company can be found <a href = "http://acuitii.life/Team">here.</a>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Unfortuntely, I cannot go too specific with the code due to NDA, but I can speak about how it went. Over the course 
                    of four months, using an Agile software development methodology, me and three others created the admin server for the 
                    Acuitii mobile application. The admin server allows admin users to manage users, manage questions in the database, and 
                    look at statistics in the mobile application. It was created with a HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend, and a Firestore
                    backend, with a NodeJS runtime environment. Our focus was a simple, understanding, aesthetically pleasing user interface,
                    along with an easy method to manage their database of over 2000 questions that are displayed through the app.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The creation of the admin server allowed users at Acuitti to be able to easily add questions or edit questions, doubling
                    the size of their database within the first few months of use. Being able to see the statistics about the mobile application
                    allows the company to manage it easier also. Overall, my group did very well on this project and Acuitti were very pleased
                    with our performance.
