                <p>eastwesthealthservices.com is a website I created while working as a receptionist at EastWest Health Services.
                    EastWest Health Services is a healthcare located in Sterling Heights. Orignally, the website was supposed to be created
                    with WordPress, but I noticed that there were frustrations with the limitations of WordPress and creative design. I was tasked
                    with learning HTML, and creating the website for the company. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The website uses an HTML/CSS/JavaScript front end, PHP backend, and just displays basic information about the company. This website mostly
                    had a positive effect on the company. It increased activity in the company after publication, since the company did not have a 
                    website before, and didn't have an easy way to contact them online. I'm currently still working on the website, I have plans to 
                    integrate user management into the website: allowing workers to log in and upload their medical documents onto a database where
                    the owners can access everything.
